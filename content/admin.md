### Viewing a single user

You may click on any user to view all of their licence information, category, Super and group, and MT-RACs. You can also few all feedback they have received.

You can also take some actions on the user:

- **Verify the user's licences**: this gives them a check mark next to their licence, signifying that it is verified by a group or Super commander
- **Promote the user to group admin** (or Super admin if you are a Super admin)
- **Remove the user from their group**: Some users that don't belong in the specific group, so you can use this function to remove them from their current group
- **Reset the user's password**: In case the user has forgotten their password, you can use this feature to help them set a new password
